# Verification

This repository contains files with (mostly Magma) code for verifying computational assertions in some of my papers.

## The Generalized Fermat Equation $x^2 + y^3 = z^{25}$

(With Nuno Freitas)

A file with Magma code verifying the claims in the paper is [here](GenFermat_2_3_25/2_3_25.magma)
