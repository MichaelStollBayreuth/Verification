# Verification

This repository contains files with (mostly Magma) code for verifying computational assertions in some of my papers.

## The Generalized Fermat Equation $x^2 + y^3 = z^{25}$

(With Nuno Freitas)

A file with Magma code verifying the claims in the paper is [here](GenFermat_2_3_25/2_3_25.magma)

## The surface parametrizing cuboids

(With Damiano Testa; [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0388))

* [cuboids.magma](Cuboids/cuboids.magma):
  this contains code to verify many of the computationsl results.

* [Section5_fibrations.magma](Cuboids/Section5_fibrations.log):
  this is the log of a Magma session computing the fibrations given in Section 5.
